    "# Malaria EDA\n",
    "In 2017, 435000 people died from malaria worldwide, making it one of the world's leading causes of deaths. In this notebook, I look at the overall numbers of malaria and the trend in estimated cases across different regions between the years 2000 and 2017, focusing on the African continent. I then look at how the incidence of cases compares with malaria funding, distributed Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) and weather conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sub-Saharan Africa makes up 91.5% of worldwide cases of malaria, but just 14% of the world's population    \n",
    "- 25% of cases worldwide occur in Nigeria  \n",
    "- Over one third of cases worldwide occur in just two countries: Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and 50% of all cases are shared between just 5 countries: Nigeria, DRC, Mozambique, India and Uganda  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The incidence of malaria transmission is highest in Africa and the Western Pacific, while the highest absolute number of cases occurs in Africa and Southeast Asia    \n",
    "- Western Africa is the most effected region in Africa, having the highest incidence of malaria   \n",
    "- Rwanda has the highest rate of malaria transmission. Almost 50% of people living in 'at risk' areas in Rwanda were infected in 2018    \n",
    "\n",
    "- 2018 saw a 31% drop in funding per capita in Africa  \n",
    "- Even with a drop in funding, the average incidence rate in Africa continued to decline in 2018  \n",
    "\n",
    "- There is no strong correlation between weather conditions and the estimated incidence of malaria, suggesting other factors play a much stronger role   \n",

So we see an overall increase in funding but also an increase in the estimated number of cases. To look more closely, we need to factor in population growth."

Below I plot the percentage of a country with 'access to an ITN' (percentage of the population that had been given an ITN in the past) with the incidence rate of malaria within that country. Each dot represents a specific year. Data from only a small number of countries was available. \n",

We should remember that the incidence rate is in many countries is estimated using a model, which also uses the prevalence of malaria parasites. These nets may be making a change in malaria cases on the ground but the model used by WHO and the inferred incidence rate might not be complete. If WHO largely uses parasite prevalence to indicate incidence rates in countries with a large gap in healthcare services and reporting, then any methods used to control malaria transmission in humans without effecting the parasites might over estimate numbers. As I have not seen available information on details of the modelling, it is hard to say, especially without errors attached.\n",

Data was used from *Berkeley Earth* and *World Weather Online*. *Berkeley Earth* data on global temperatures is recorded temperature data, whereas *World Weather Online* uses historical forecast data. Berkeley Earth has data available between 2000 and 2013 and *World Weather Online* has available data from July 2008 onwards. To cross check the recorded and forecast datasets, I compared the average temperature data from the two organisations below, with both plots being similar. \n",
